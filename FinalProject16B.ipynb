    "The project is trying to address the growing concern among Generation Z and Millennials regarding the increasing difficulty of homeownership due to rising housing prices and rental costs. This analysis aims to identify and quantify the various factors that influence housing prices and rent. The goal is to create a multiple linear regression model that can reasonably predict housing and rent prices, so that consumers can understand the trends in housing right now. With this new found knowledge, they can make more informed financial decisions. We will start by creating an MLR with all potential factors in our data. Using a combination of partial F-tests and ANOVAs, we will determine the significant predictors. Then we will establish a machine learning model to create and train MLRs before performing an F-test to determine the best model. Finally, we will check to make sure our model assumptions for MLR are satisfied before drawing conclusions."

    "Day after day, you constantly hear the news rerpot about the struggles that Generation Z and Millenials face. There is a growing shared sentiment amongst Generation Z and Millenials that the world is filled with dread and gloom. The world is becoming harder to survive and live in causing worries about the future. Housing is one of these issues with many people exclaiming how rent and housing prices only seem to go up. There are countless stories of people paying outrageous prices for poor living situations that would have been cheaper in the past. \n",

    "As students looking to work in the data science field this project allows us to practice our abilities in pattern recognition and data management for a topic which concerns us and our colleagues. I, Eric, am a math/economics major so a topic such as the housing market and the variables which can make the market fluctuate has a direct tie into my studies in business and mathematical modeling. I, Fox, am a financial actuarial math major so the analysis of contributing factors to an economic trend will be part of my daily work life in the future. One of our personal greatest fears is being able to secure a comfortable and proper living after college. Housing is crucial for that lifestyle and understanding the general trends that affect housing prices/rental costs will give us an advantage in decision making when we enter the housing market."
