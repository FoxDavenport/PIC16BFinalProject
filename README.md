# PIC16BFinalProject (Analysis of Factors that Contribute to Housing Prices)
Eric and Fox's PIC 16B Final Project Repository

# What Project About:
The project is trying to address the growing concern among Generation Z and Millennials regarding the increasing difficulty of homeownership due to rising housing prices and rental costs. This analysis aims to identify and quantify the various factors that influence housing prices and rent. As students looking to work in the data science field this project allows us to practice our abilities in pattern recognition and data management for a topic which concerns us and our colleagues. I, Eric, am a math/economics major so a topic such as the housing market and the variables which can make the market fluctuate has a direct tie into my studies in business and mathematical modeling. I, Fox, am a financial actuarial math major so the analysis of contributing factors to an economic trend will be part of my daily work life in the future. One of our personal greatest fears is being able to secure a comfortable and proper living after college. Housing is crucial for that lifestyle and understanding the general trends that affect housing prices/rental costs will give us an advantage in decision making when we enter the housing market.

# Resources Needed:
In terms of the resources needed for our project and our future analysis we need comprehensive datasets which include variables such as housing prices over time, rental rates, location, demographic, etc. One of the resources we have found pertains to an ongoing competition on kaggle “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.” This source offers datasets pertaining to exactly the variables we will need such as “Saleprice” “Neighborhood” and much more. In terms of other resources outside of data we do not need much. Things such as computing power-- we anticipate that any computer or Macbook should be just fine. 

We are still finalizing the type of data we will be working with, but we are considering using the MySQL databases to scrap high quality housing data. MySQL is a cloud database that would allow us to cut back on computing power and only need a Macbook or Windows computer to work with. There are free existing databases hosted on MySQL already and provided by Microsoft that would allow us to make this a strong viable approach.

# Previous Work:
The specific past work we are looking at walks us through how to train a baseline Random Forest Model on the House Prices dataset pertaining to House Price prediction. We can expect to learn a lot from past competition submissions in building our own machine learning algorithm. Overall the competition board on kaggle has a tremendous variety of projects already done regarding the housing market with step by step tutorials on how their specific machine learning algorithms were trained and how to create them. We anticipate using a plethora of different models and comparing and utilizing each in our final conclusions. It also expects us to create models from training and testing data.

# Required Tools and Skills:
As we are still finalizing our decision on what type of data to work with, the ability to use SQL through SSMS may be necessary. SQL stands for structured query language and is a programming language that allows us to extract and manipulate data from large databases. Currently, we are searching for some type of census database involving housing trends. SQL would allow us to scrap high quality data from a large and reliable datasource by specifying parameters. After we have done preliminary rounds of obtaining data and sorting it by the specific parameters we want, we will have to create statistical models to observe the significance of various predictors on housing/rental prices. We’ll have to learn about how to create statistical models and how to test model assumptions to ensure our model is well fitted for our data. Furthermore, we will have to learn how to perform significance tests to see if the model is overall significant and which factors are significant. If any factors are not significant to our data, we will have to remove them and see if our new model without these factors is more significant than the previous one.

MySQL/SSMS will be required to use SQL with our databases and JupyterLab/JupyterNotebook will be needed to use Python to create and test our models from the data. It is also possible we will have to use R-Studio and R-Code for model analysis depending on the limitations of Python. 

# What We Will Learn:
From this project, not only will we obtain a deeper grasp of the housing market and what factors shift the prices of the market, but also hone our skills in data management and machine learning tools. By learning the ins and outs of the housing market we see real world applications in what we are learning in our economics classes and get to utilize our newfound knowledge of real estate economics in making life decisions going forward. Furthermore, the practice and skills we develop from this project will aid us in any data projects we have in the future. We expect to apply advanced data visualization techniques and learn better how to interpret and present our complex data insights effectively and cohesively.
